The "images" folder has the images that form the example test cases.

The "hex" folder has the hex dumps of the images. These would be the inputs for "Decode and Extract". Make sure to test your code using the Compile & Test feature on the site before submitting; this will ensure that your code runs correctly in our environment.

The "decode_output" folder has the correct outputs for the "Decode and Extract" portion of the challenge.

The correct outputs for the "Name that shape" portion of the challenge is just the name of the shape, which is contained in the file names (circle, square, or triangle).

Thanks for participating!
